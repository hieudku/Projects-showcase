This is my very first project on my Web development journey.

In this project, I have built a simple Landing page with HTML and CSS using skills that I have learnt.

Some aspects of HTML such as links and images to other pages, setting up header, body, footer and divs in between and where to put them. Also the use of classes were implemented.

Took many hours practicing and testing on CSS to get to the outcome that I wanted, on things such as calling tag names, class names and CSS cascading order. I also use a lot of flex-boxes in order to keep things proportional and aligned.

Overrall, after finishing with this project, my aim to maintain what I have learnt on HTML and CSS was achieved, it was definitely helpful to build something that will concrete what I learnt so far.
